## Sprint Review and Retrospective
The Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable from my final project is included in this repository:

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating user stories help with this?
I interpret user needs by focusing first on the value the user expects rather than on the technical implementation details. Creating user stories helps translate abstract requirements into clear, user-centered goals by framing features from the user's perspective and defining what success looks like through acceptance criteria. This approach reduces ambiguity, aligns development with real user expectations, and makes it easier to break work into testable, incremental pieces that can be validated early through feedback.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile process do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach program development iteratively, starting with small, functional increments and refining them over time based on feedback and testing. Agile processes such as backlog refinement, sprint planning, continuous testing, and sprint retrospectives allow me to adapt to changing requirements while maintaining quality and momentum. In future development work, I plan to continue using Scrum-based practices to improve collaboration, manage uncertainty, and ensure development efforts remain aligned with user needs and project goals.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means communicating clearly, collaborating respectfully, and taking shared responsibility for the success of the product. It involves actively participating in planning and review discussions, asking clarifying questions early, and being open to feedback from teammates. This course reinforced that strong teamwork depends not only on technical skills but also on accountability, adaptability, and a willingness to support others to achieve common objectives.
